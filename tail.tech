he sings, misquoting both Ravikovitch and Snoop Dogg. Poetry
was nowhere in my father's house, or money either, our doorposts
marked pass-over; although in a pinch Dad could recite Kipling's
"Gunga Din." Make fun if you must, my mother says, but look in
the mirror and I'm here to tell you that your father was a better man
than all those anti-Semitic Pounds and Eliots rolled up into one.

That was twenty-three years ago, before my mother, cradling
his neck and not yet crying, waited, while in East New York,
the ambulance raced, and the Angel of Death loitered.
Are you comfortable? she asks, adjusting my father's pillow,
while he, ever the emcee, mimics Henny Youngman's I make
a living. Poetry makes nothing happen, Auden might repeat,
were he here, and what wouldn't I give, at this moment,
for his stiff British upper lip. What's one more death in the family,
Otto Frank argues, expunging not grief but sex from his daughter's
diary, and what parent today would dare to play jury or judge.

V.

Are you writing another Holocaust poem? the Angel of Consciousness,
who sits, while I muse, on my right shoulder and whom I often confuse
with her errant two-headed twin, the Angel of Conscience, asks.
And now I'm recalling my home office, the Akeidah above the desk,
the knife blade drawn downward, that Angel, what's her name,
restraining Abraham's implausibly blood-stained arm. And because
I, exiled to the basement when my Isaac arrived, overlooked
that drawing, it hung ten months above my newborn son's head.
I feel wicked sleeping in this warm bed, my daughter proclaims,
rehearsing her Anne Frank and pausing anxiously for applause.

VI.

Burn everything after I'm dead, Kafka said, poking his prewar
Jewish head into yet one more of my poems. He's trying to explain
the fatherland to the fatherless. No one reads poetry anymore, anyway,
my mother, quoting from her own unpublished diary, writes. And who
doesn't want to go on living even after death? my daughter recites.
I'm at my desk, buried again in this moldy basement, begging for quiet,
while upstairs I can hear my great-uncles Abbott and Costello arguing,
and now they're chasing each other around the kitchen like Keystone Cops,
and now they're singing each other's praises like Eliot and Pound, and now
they're comforting each other like the Angels of Death and Forgetfulness.

VII.

Quiet, I call out; castigating the offenders brought back buddy-styleâ€”
heads bowed and hand in hand; two pretty preteens caught hiding
behind stacks of spectacles, confiscated suitcases, and desecrated scrolls.
I want to face them toward this tearful Tower of Faces and teach them
proper museum protocol. But they are still unapologetic, giggling,
and trading one-liners, these entertaining angels in training. I'd planned
to quote Kafka or even Kipling, but it's clear I've lost control and now
I can't recall a single thing I came here to say. I am simply a young girl
badly in need of some rollicking fun, Anne whispers as I open the door
for a little air, letting her play, at least for today, out in the sun.
